# Java
The examples are created with JSweet http://www.jsweet.org. <br>
which is a Java transpiler into JavaScript ( can be tested here : http://www.jsweet.org/jsweet-live-sandbox/ ). <br> 
(That is the main reason why all java classes are in one file)

To play around with my snippets just copy paste it into the transpiler, 
hit "Transpile" and run, press f12 -> select Console Tab, and see the System.out.println commands there.
